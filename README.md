# Afritek-Analysis

### Project Introduction:

AfriTech Electronics Ltd. is a U.S.-based company recognized globally for its innovation in smartphones, tablets, and wearable technology. With a workforce of 200 employees, the company achieved $2 million in revenue in 2022, driven by its commitment to quality and cutting-edge technology.

Despite its growth, AfriTech is currently facing significant brand reputation challenges. Negative social media sentiment, rising customer complaints about product defects and service delays, and recent high-profile product recalls have eroded consumer trust. These issues have also been amplified by competitors capitalizing on the companyâ€™s struggles, leading to a decline in sales and market share. This project aims to analyze the root causes of these issues and develop data-driven strategies to restore brand reputation and enhance customer satisfaction.
